# Rim Fire

Trying to visualize the extent of the [Rim Fire](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-yosemite-fire-san-francisco-power-rim-fire20130823,0,1157539.story) using shapefile data from [earthdata.nasa.gov](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/near-real-time-data/firms/active-fire-data). If anyone knows of a better data source please let me know.

For now, just a copy of the EOSDIS's data on fires in U.S.A. (Conterminous) and Hawaii for the last twenty four hours, a method to convert that file to GeoJSON, and an embedded [gist](https://gist.github.com/ngoldman/6328849) on a web server. Will try to get farther after breakfast and bike ride.
