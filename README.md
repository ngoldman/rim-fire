# Rim Fire

Trying to visualize the extent of the rim fire using data from [earthdata.nasa.gov](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/near-real-time-data/firms/active-fire-data).

For now, just a copy of the EOSDIS's data on fires in U.S.A. (Conterminous) and Hawaii for the last twenty four hours, a method to convert that file to GeoJSON, and an embedded gist on a web server. Will try to get farther after breakfast and bike ride.
